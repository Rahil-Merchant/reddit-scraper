1,My girlfriend killed herself a week after we broke up,"Hello. I don't really know how to start this. I guess I'll tell you how I met my ex.

Roughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her ""previous life"" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.

Things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.

After a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn't let her. The drinking got worse. I'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.

One night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn't give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn't hear my music. I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don't want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.

I tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. 

One week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. How it had been the last straw.

I feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. It's never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I've been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can't.

Thanks for reading to the end.",2019-06-21 01:54:11,188,3232,0.99,Throw6524285

3,Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.," 

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you.",2019-12-09 21:41:43,364,2805,0.99,Fantastic-Profession

During the pandemic it has been hard. I live alone, I don't have many friends, I'm 50 years old, lost my business and really feel that I have zero to no marketable skills to offer an employer. I'm fat, out of shape, and a long list of health issues (physical and mental). 

The other day, I was out on my balcony (twelfth floor) thinking how easy it would be to jump. This is not the first time I have been out there like this. Just when I had the courage to climb on the rail, I looked down and saw a little child making chalk drawings on the sidewalk. Then my mind wandered and thought about how he would never be able to enjoy playing in front of his home because of what I was going to do. Him and his mom live in a ground floor unit, so I would basically be landing on their front walk.

13,"I am never ""suicidal enough"" to be heard. I am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly ""too"" everything to be worthy of any support.","And I am gradually withering away because of it.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

21,It’s extremely messed up that you can’t even go to a psych hospital for help with suicidal thoughts without getting a multi-thousand dollar hospital bill.,"I was in a psych ward once when I was 17. I struggle with suicidal ideation daily. I would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it weren’t for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it. My bill at my psych hospital was about $20,000. All because I wanted to jump off a bridge. You can’t tell anyone that you’re suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital, but you can’t go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner, just making your problems even worse. There’s no good solution. I want to have the right to die. Or at least get free help. The suicidal hotline doesn’t do shit. I want real help. And not to be thrown in a hospital. This system is horrible. We are all victims of it. It’s time for a mental health industry overhaul.",2020-06-09 19:57:27,133,1597,1.0,nbailey73

I’m not even pretty or funny or social or anything to make up for being so pathetic. I’m literally just fucking done trying",2020-02-04 03:27:11,181,1556,0.99,ghostiic
23,"People always say; ""just"" get a job, ""just"" find a new hobby, ""just"" go for a walk, ""just"" make new friends. Newsflash: IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.","Every conversation I have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following:

""Have you considered listening to music?""

""Have you considered going for a walk?""

""Have you considered taking up a new hobby?""

""Have you considered making new friends?""

""Have you considered volunteering/getting a job?""

It happens every time. It happens in every conversation. It happened yesterday, and it happened twenty minutes ago. I finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because I just can't call one, and this is the only ""help"" I received.

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

I would be getting help. But I can’t, I know the consequences. The hospital punishes me. I would use a hotline but I don’t want police coming to my house. I’m scared. I’m the most scared I’ve been in my life. 





I know nobody will read this, but here I want to tell my story. The truth is, I want to live. I just want the pain to stop. 




I’m a 13 year old girl. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times. I’ve been suffering a lot. I have no self-confidence. I have no love for myself. 
I sew. I sew dolls. I love my dolls. Nobody will understand. 



Here is my first goodbye.  To my dolls: I love you. I know when I leave you will go to. I’m sorry. My heart breaks. I wish I could’ve taken care of you better. You saved my life 2 times. You helped me when I needed it the most. I will say all your names. I love all of you. I’m in tears. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t want to go. Kazumi, Sayaka, Kyoko, Mami, Madoka, Luka, Rin, Homura, Yachiyo, Iroha, Sana, Felicia, Tsuruno, Nikki, Ren, Rena, Mitama, Alina, Kanade, Sakura, Rika, Gumi, Emma, Ruby, Weiss, Blake, Yang, Yowane, Nagisa. I’m so sorry. I love you. All of you




To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now, in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now, because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish. But please know, I love you. I love you so much Binxy. 




I don’t know what to do. I want help. But I can’t with out going to the hospital. I’m sorry. Please forgive me. Hold my hand. Give me a hug. Anything. With one final cry, please. I don’t want to go. But I can’t stay. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.",2020-01-13 20:21:28,206,1511,0.98,TheDarkVixen
25,"Does anyone else have this really destructive pattern of feeling suicidal and ruining everything in your life because you think you won’t be around to deal with it, only to fail or not even attempt suicide and have to try to pick up the pieces?",,2019-08-11 14:31:04,71,1508,1.0,ghostiic
26,I just saw a post asking “If you committed suicide a year ago what beautiful things would you have missed?”. I can’t think of a single thing.,"When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, things don’t feel the same as they did when we were best friends. I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed. It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 3 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year ever that he has not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

• • • • •

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. 

I’m so, so tired.

31,Chocolate saved my life,"My last serious suicide attempt was in July 2018. I had booked a hotel in a nearby city for two days for ''a conference'' and randomly packed up so it wouldn't be suspicious to my mom. I didn't want to do it in my room because in a way I didn't want to defile it? I don't know how to explain it. 
My plan was to do it as soon as I got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and I wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. 
I opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when I opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. It was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits. It had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper. My heart dropped and I couldn't stop crying. Eventually I think I fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when I woke up, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. I felt loved. My mom put that chocolate there to surprise me because she knows how sometimes I'll forget to eat when I'm overworked.

37,“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” I hate sayings like this with all my heart.,"People who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it’s like to be in severe pain. They have no clue whatsoever. They’re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don’t respond to treatment or they just don’t believe it. They can’t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option. And it’s because they’re basing their views on their OWN experience. Their OWN feelings and thoughts which aren’t the same as people contemplating suicide. 

If people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically. For example, a person posts that they are going to kill themselves. They have suffered in pain for years, they are damaged, they’ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain. Without the fortune of not being in their shoes, can they not understand why suicide is a viable option? Even if you can’t feel their pain, surely the facts can speak for themselves. You have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” or “we have to play the cards we are dealt”. 

Do they really think that the suicidal person( after years of pain) is going to think “this quote has changed my perspective entirely. I think I’m going to live now’”. Whether the person intends to or not, sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options. I’m not saying they should just let them die if they’ve posted something like that. But patronising and bullshit quotes, when you can’t relate, just makes me pissed off. 

Although it’s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out, they can’t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid. In general I just hate sayings and quotes. They shouldn’t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case. There’s no right way to respond to someone suicidal, but saying quotes is not the way. Best way I can think of is just saying ‘I’m here if you need me for anything, if you want to talk”. I’m just a big believer in free will. No one should be confined to a life of pain.",2020-06-29 00:40:23,156,1323,0.99,herry720

44,I’m a Nurse who killed people,"I can’t shake the guilt. I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe. I just needed to vent, thanks for allowing me to do so.",2020-04-18 19:03:57,64,1255,0.98,cowchunks
45,I’m an attractive white man from a wealthy family. The odds were always in my favor. I think I’m gonna shoot myself in the face.,"I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",2019-09-10 05:26:30,124,1215,1.0,SQLwitch
50,"3 days ago was my birthday, I should’ve done it but my dog and a redditor saved my life","3 days ago was my birthday. I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.


EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK GUYS MY INBOX IS GETTING FLOODED WITH SUPPORT, SILVERS AND A PLATINUM. I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT. I NEVER FELT LOVED LIKE THIS BEFORE. TO ALL WHO MESSAGED ME SAYING THAT THEY ARE GLAD THAT I’M STILL HERE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO THOSE PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED ON THIS POST. I CAN’T REPLY TO YOU ALL ONE BY ONE BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. IMMA LET MY DOG KNOW THAT HE GOT SO MUCH RECOGNITION FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD BOI. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRANGERS WHO MADE ME FELT THAT THEY LOVE ME AND CARE FOR ME SO MUCH.

How could I ever look you in the eye, how could I ever face you with the way things turned out? My past selves. I'm happy for you. Happy that you got to experience wonder, happiness and joy. And that you always dreamed big. Your dreams were always too big, too much disparity between your skills, and what you wanted. Knowing that those silly dreams thought up by some silly little kid are all but impossible, makes the decision to go a little easier. It's a stark reminder of the cold unforgiving nature of the world. A reality check.

61,i wish nobody cared about me so i could kill myself without destroying other lives in the process,"hi. i have been struggling with severe depression for almost 2 years now. i don’t really want to get into it but it’s because of something that is no ones fault and just a case of really bad luck. i wish the people who cared about me recognised that i was struggling and that there’s nothing to do to fix it. but i know deep down that if i kill myself they will blame themselves and it could ruin them. 

i don’t want to be here, i’m only here because i don’t want to ruin the lives of the people who care for me. sometimes i think that i can just continue to live on despite being miserable for the sake of other people’s happiness, but i’m not sure whether i’m going to make it. almost every thought i have eventually loops back to suicide, no matter how happy the initial thought. 

i’ve made a plan to stick it out until my siblings finish their exams. after that i’m pretty sure i’m going to kill myself.

None of this matters, life is arbitrary. We're thrown into a system completely devoid of any compassion, this isn't life, this is servitude and I refuse to play along anymore. I'm so fucking tired of plastering a smile on my face and pretending like everything is going to be okay. 

Have you looked at the news lately? Everything is falling apart around us, the planet is on fire, people are being rounded up, privacy is non-existent and we're told repeatedly that we have no value unless we've been commoditized. Buy this, buy that, you need this random, useless tatt but we don't! We don't *need* any of it but it's still rammed down our throats day in, day out, bombarding us from every fucking direction and I'm just exhausted. 

I can't do this for another 40 years, I'm done, I'm checking out and I don't mean from the hotel. I'm going to have a large gin and tonic while I run a bath. It might relax me amd there's a niggling voice at the back of mind screaming ""PLEASE DON'T DO THIS"" but I don't want to listen anymore.

65,This quote about suicide is feeling far too accurate,"""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

This quote is from Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.

67,"The logistics of killing yourself are so endlessly, frustratingly complicated","I would literally attempt suicide right now if I thought it would work, but I just feel like I would just end up with permanent damage and be accused of being an attention seeker, when in reality, I just want to die quietly without any fuss. 

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

I wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. I wish I didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. I wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. I wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. I wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. I wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what I do with my own freaking life that I never even wanted in the first place.",2020-05-15 12:00:10,81,1079,0.99,Vegetable-Echo

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

Edit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

Edit 4: People are surprised that I'm over this so quick and I'm calm about it, I guess it's down to the fact I live by the rule that is ""the pains compulsory, sufferings optional""

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. 

Thank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂",2020-05-30 12:57:57,115,1044,0.99,throwawayiguess12344

79,I'm a pedophile and I think I'm ready to kill myself,"I've never had a normal sex drive and I thought I was asexual for a while, but I guess the reality is more insidious. I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.
Edit: Still here. Going to look into some more mental or physical health options before making a decision I think. Thank you for your kindness even if I don't understand it.",2020-04-12 09:52:58,194,1045,0.96,Legosi13

83,Nobody talks about the after attempt,"I tried to kill myself. I overdosed heavily on a cocktail of pills and medicines. The advice i have? Don't. Nobody talks about the aftermath of when somebody saves your life. The people who know you are torn apart by grief even though you survived. And you get to see it. And you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells, treat you like you're a kicked puppy.  And the guilt is worse than that before. Because you caused that and they won't admit it to you. The guilt is soul destroying. And then there's you. Your stomach can't handle anything but water and plain bread. The sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet. The shaking for no reason- entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment. Sleep? No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so. And that's if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place. Oh. And when you finally think your body has recovered? Its worse. You cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit. Like youre peeing out of your ass. Water can even make you feel sick. 

Okay sure. You wanna die. But a lot don't succeed. And the failure is grim. I have liver damage, my stomach linings are non existent. I'm suffering more than before and i could never try again because of who i affected and the damage i've done.

Edit: it's been 3 weeks. I have to take medication for my stomach otherwise the pain is horrible and i am still just shitting and vomiting stomach acid",2020-02-20 16:24:06,159,1026,0.99,TaRoWa03
84,"They'll let you be homeless but tell you suicide is ""never the answer""..","Honestly, this is one of the most puzzling things about society. People tell you that ""we don't live in a vaccum. everyone has people who care"" along with other shamings of suicide calling you ""cowardly"".

87,"If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.","That’s what I feel has happened to me. It’s like I don’t have the right to say “I’m sad” anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

I’ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe it’s because I’m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I don’t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized.

89,I woke up...alive??,"I am so confused.

I am supposed to be dead.

Yesterday I tried EVERYTHING.

I put a bag over my head and attempted that three times. Then I proceeded to try and cut myself but I was so bad at it.

By this point I had a set of bleeding scars all over my body (I’m a teen girl who lives in a tropical climate so I had never really cut in my arms before).

I then dressed myself in a hoodie and jeans and headed to the river. I jumped in and tried to drown myself, taking huge gulps of water. I couldn’t. I was coughing up so much water and walked in shame towards my home.

THEN, I popped every single medication that I had into my mouth. I only remember getting a really bad stomach ache and puking twice.

I woke up!?

God, how hard is to die. I suppose the pills didn’t work. Now I can’t hide the scars on my arms and I can’t simply tell my mother “hey, yes, you know those dozens of tablets of expensive medication we had? Well, I swallowed them all.”

edit: my anger doesn’t come from the fact that people are trying to give me hope, that is not the purpose of this post, the purpose of this post isn’t to spread the message that “it never gets better” because it definitely can and has for many people. The issue is when people use the stupid phrase “it gets better” as if it as definite event that is 100% going to occur, and it is highly offensive to me because I believed that as a kid, I believed that things just HAD to get better, but they haven’t. I’m aware that things CAN get better, just like things can get worse, but it’s not GOING to 100% get better because no one can really dictate that unless you can see into the future. Saying that shit just sets people up for disappointment , it’s a statement based on delusions and false hope. There are some people who will die depressed, there are some people who will die in pain, people whose illnesses will kill them, and to say that it gets better, as if depression is simply a phase or passing mood, is extremely invalidating and minimizes the severity of the illness.",2020-06-24 21:46:30,319,989,0.96,alexamurillo

94,Anyone else going to miss the part of them that could have been so great?,"The real part of yourself. The part that had dreams and ambitions. The part that dreamt of meeting someone you could fall in love with. The part that used to get comfort from things so simple such as showering, sleeping and eating your favourite foods. Maybe movies, tv shows or sports that made you feel alive and hopeful. The innocent part, now buried by the pain inflicted by your mind. This is not a post of optimism, more just typing what floats in my complex mind.

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too. Do not let hope control your life. Personally, no matter how comforting hope can be, it has a harmful agenda in the long run. What if the hoping never ends.",2020-03-28 22:18:14,69,966,1.0,herry720

I hate you because you never loved me enough. I hate you because you never trusted me enough. And I hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.

Little did i know, that letter would be read by everyone! And i mean everyone. I woke up and a therapist was beside me and the first thing she said was that she read my letter. I was so shocked and couldnt say anything for 3 seconds or more. Apparently she thought i didnt believed her so she just quoted the most disturbing and private part of it to me. My mother and all the people in the hospital read it too. 
I had to get into a clinic for one month and no surprise they all knew what i wrote in it.. i felt so shitty because these was personal stuff i didnt want to share with other people!!!",2019-07-20 19:06:56,45,907,0.99,xcrossq
118,What's the point of life when I'm supposed to spend 5 days a week working for another 50 years?,"I cant work without wanting to kill myself but I have to work. :( Am I just broken or lazy? I've never even heard of a job I think I would enjoy, so I'm just stuck working jobs that are meaningless to me. It's also worth noting that I'm disabled, so what I'm capable of is limited. Anyways, I've been increasingly more suicidal whenever the reality hits me that I just won't enjoy 5/7ths of my life. I get 2 days a week to barely recover and then it's back to hating existence. I can't stop crying about it. I've been to the psych ward 3 times and it's only been temporarily helpful. Every therapist I've been to tries to teach me coping skills but I can't deep breathe my way into liking work. And setting up rewards for myself doesn't do anything for me (whoop dee doo, I get to eat my favorite meal when I get home. Doesn't change anything for me). How do normal people do it?? I feel like at least half of people with full-time jobs should be suicidal but they just... magically aren't.

I just want to rest, to spend time with people I care about. I want to have time and money to enjoy my life, but I sure as fuck won't last to retirement. I don't think I'm going to last much longer at all actually, which sucks because when I don't have to worry about money I'm actually pretty happy.

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more. 
~••••••~
2007
We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster.

2013
It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm. 
~•••••~
2015 
A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did.

2016
My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend.

I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone.

136,"Likely won't commit suicide, but if someone pointed a gun at my head, I'd probably let them pull the trigger.","Does anyone else feel this way? I've been depressed for so many years, and I've been suicidal all this time. I've yet to attempt suicide, although I've come very close.

I doubt I'll commit suicide any time soon, partially due to the small spurts of dim hope I feel once in a blue moon. The bigger reason though, is because my sole living direct-family member is having a rough patch, and I fear they'd kill themselves too.

Nevertheless, if someone threatened to shoot me with a gun or I was caught up in a situation that endangered my life, I probably wouldn't mind too much. It would be even better if I could sacrifice my life for someone else—maybe then my life wouldn't have been in vain. I recognize the hypocrisy in that statement; after all, if I were willing to sacrifice my life for someone else, then why not sacrifice myself and live for the sake of my family member's life?

138,"Just graduated from college today, planning on taking my life tonight.","Like the title says, today I received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight. I am not sure why I am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why I took my life on a day I was supposed to be happy.

Here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. I grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as I was. I also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. Growing up, I would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever I did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me.

143,It hursts seeing your friends have fun when your at home thinking about whether or not you should live.,"No one knows that I’m going though this so I can’t really blame her for ignoring me. When I do bring up my feelings and how she hurt me, it always turns into an argument. “Oh so you’re saying I’m just a bad friend?” And then when I don’t tell her it’s “you never tell me anything.” I’m so tired of having to tell her what to do or how to make things up to me. We’ve been friends for 6 years, I wish she just knew to apologize without being contradicting and defensive. When she tells me that she’s hurt I beg her to tell me why. I make sure to sit down with her and get to the bottom of things until she feels better. 
Anyway, all of that is just useless drama and doesn’t have a lot to do with me thinking of killing myself, but it sure doesn’t make it easier to live. Basically it sucks that I hate myself and my friends seem to hate me too.

I survived and now I’m looking ahead to the future. I must’ve survived for a reason. It’s going to be hard but I need to at least give this a chance. I hope all of you do as well.

145,'sUicIDe iS tHe eAsY wAy OUt',"Is that supposed to deter me?

Why would I want to take the hard way? I'm TIRED of taking the hard way, that's literally why I'm suicidal in the first place.

Trying to make us feel bad for wanting to die really isn't helpful. 

It just makes me feel like a terrible person for being weak which makes me want to die even more.

I really don't get some of these arguments...



Edit: I don't mean to say that the actual act of dying/taking your life is easy, but that suicide is giving up, and giving up is easier than continuing to live. I hope that makes sense.

It's like the actual suicide will be intense and scary, but afterwards I'll never have to experience anything ever again and I won't ever have to be conscious again.",2020-04-03 15:07:13,73,830,0.99,idkwhattoputlol69

147,"I told my abusive narcissistic sadist of a mother to “Fuck off, eat the shit that comes out of your mouth & die painfully you sadistic cunt!” Right before cutting contact with her.","My mother has been cruel, verbally, emotionally, psychologically & physically abusive ever since I can remember. For example when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia & severe depression when I was 7, she took a tarantula from outside, threw me in a closet, threw the spider in & locked me in there while screaming like a banshee. That 8 legged monstrosity bit me 5 times before I passed out from fear. When I woke up, there were 4 more bites. She always made me her scapegoat. The first out of my 9 suicide attempts took place when I was 9 years old. When she found out that I started cutting myself, she severely beat me & called me a mistake. Years have passed & after starting to see a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with severe PTSD & a severe anxiety disorder. I tend to drink to cope with my problems. If anyone were to personally ask me how I would describe myself, I’d say, “Damaged beyond recovery & broken beyond repair.” I barely sleep in fear of yet again reliving my past in my nightmares. I’m 24 now & I’ll be 25 this year. Damn, to those who read this post, I need to know. Was I wrong to tell her off like that?",2020-04-25 20:10:28,144,817,0.98,MaveeL
148,I just joined reddit. I'm 40 years old and suicidal. I have problems with porn. I've never had sex with a woman.,"At the suggestion of my therapist, he recommended I join reddit.  So, I'm giving this a try.  I'm 40 years old and suicidal.  I live in New Hampshire, USA.  I have been thinking lately, that, it is my time to leave this world.  I am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years.  I've never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex with a woman.  I have only seen one escort in Boston, Massachusetts.  I was excited (too excited) about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and I were lying in bed nude (she was caressing my chest up and down) and she put her hand over my d\*ck, my rocket launched unexpectedly - yes, premature ejaculation.  Sometimes it happens.  Needless to say, we didn't have sex.

I am so depressed and lonely.  I have come to the realization that I'm unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore.  I hate my job.  I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.

My porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.

In 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.

I did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.

I've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.

The only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.

Any advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.

150,My despicable legacy,"Today, as 25th may I've decided to kill myself. Not sure if it's because I've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because I finally understand things I didn't before. I do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things I've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

I feel invisible. 

I've been invisible my whole life. While never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
I feel alone, even when I'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something I've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

At first, I was born as an accident, I've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
I was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. I lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until I was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
From 0 to 4 life was decently good, I don't personally recall any bad experiences, but I was told recently from my grandmother that I would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. I don't know why. 
My dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. He was present, to be fair, he was more present when I couldn't remember. 

From 5 to 12 I lived in the flat I mentioned early. I was there alone most of the day. Now I think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? Well, one that clearly didn't care enough. At 6 I joined school, the same monotous hell I assisted for 12 years. I never really fitted with the average person. I wasn't an outcast, or a creep, I had friends. They weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. We would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
I never did good in school, I barely did decent. Parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. Luckily my mother and dad broke up when I was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
My father never, ever hit me. He was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
Nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which I completely regret. 

At the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? Some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. I didn't understand it. I had no idea why it was happening. Suddenly, the world was no more love painted. A great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. To see everyone as an enemy. Years later I understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness I feel every day; that was the starting point. 
At 12, I cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. I enjoyed it to some degree. I never did it to a serious level, and I stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. Months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
I forgot to mention that I've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. So a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

At this point I'm a bit drunk. Getting everything ready for my departure, as I listen to There's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

Sadly I never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. I never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. I've always been by my own, I've always been alone. What saddens me the most, is that I've never been heard. I've always been ignored.

Invisible. That's what I've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

Everyone around me gets talked by others. Others interact with others, but not me. 
It covers many aspects, not only been talked but... I don't know how to explain it. I am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes I believe I'm really invisible? 
Sometimes I talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
Philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet I cannot answer myself. If I'm ignored like that, am I even there? Was I part of a community? 

But this is about the good things I did, too. 
I joined the fire brigade. Had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, I helped men, women and children. Tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness I felt. 

I also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! I called her Mamou, she had 4 little kitties which I gifted to people I knew who would take good care of them. 

But it's been 2 years since I've been living on my own, Mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. But overall, made something a bit more clear for me. It wasn't hatred what I felt for the world, but disappointment. We've come so far as a species. We have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself I am guilty of this. I haven't done anything remarkable. 
I am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

For those reasons I am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? I am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. I mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

That leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. That's what some of my friends did to me. They ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
Sure, I did a mistake, I admit it. I did many mistakes. But looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, I never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

Quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances I had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. Tho it hasn't been all bad, I got fit. I lost a lot of weight. I've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

Anyway, to the last point. The things I most regret in life? Probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
I regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

If you made it this far, I cannot properly explain how much I appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. This is more attention than all the one I've been given through my whole life. It felt really good to open up after so long

I am Tomás Renard, these are the last words I want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. If anyone is concerned, know I will leave happy that at least read this post. I will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeño wine",2020-05-25 08:28:30,131,818,0.99,

152,I want to kill myself to avoid the future,"Generally speaking, my life isn’t terrible right now. But I know the future is going to be unimaginably painful and it scares the crap out of me. So much so that I’m willing to end it all to avoid it. 

Maybe I’m just overreacting, since what I’m scared of is what pretty much everyone goes through. But I really don’t want responsibility. I hate that the more I age, the more people expect of me. I don’t want to turn 18 and suddenly be an adult, thrown out to the world. There’s so much that will have to be done in my life and I can’t handle it. 

Getting into university, getting a job, a drivers licence, hell even just the idea of having to get groceries... it all scares me. I feel like everything is happening too fast. 

I hate that this problem isn’t something I can just fix. It will never “get better” because what troubles me is life itself. How am I supposed to fix the fact that I’m too anxious to live?",2020-04-13 06:27:21,71,804,0.99,tellmeapart

There has been attempts before in the past, but never too serious to the point where I needed to be hospitalized. Once saw a post that said, ""Can I have a 30 day free trial of being dead?"" Never related to something so much in my damn life. Let me be an accident, not to the point where I die, but maybe in a coma for a while. Just to escape. 

I'm the friend that no ones wants to hang out with. I don't have anybody. I made a bad reputation for myself in high school and college (mainly just rumor-based) and I never bounced back from it because of my anxiety. I don't know who I am. I don't know what love is.

Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening.",2019-08-28 10:02:26,45,781,0.99,ThebodyofTyler
166,Attempt failed. Currently in the hospital.,"I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. 

Stay strong and reconsider your choice. 


EDIT: I didn't think my post would get so much attention, seeing as my other posts wouldn't get much. I'm sorry if I can't reply to all of the comments it's really a lot! However, thank you to all the kind people and positive messages. I'm glad to see my story is helping others as well. ",2018-03-04 19:24:58,88,776,0.99,vr16

Some people are fighting their hardest against impossible odds, some people never had a chance, some are nihilistic and don't see any reason to live and some like me have hereditary depression. And who cares? Genuinely who cares? I've come on here just to rant and I'd bet any amount of money you who's reading this did the exact same. Everyone is self absorbed, the only people who care about you (if any) can't help. They have their own lives to live. They beg people with depression and who are suicidal to ""talk"" well who do we fucking talk to? I don't have the money for a fancy fucking therapist, I honestly don't just feel sorry for myself right now.. I feel sorry for mankind. Do you think in a tribe if someone is crying they walk past them and pretend they didn't see them? For whatever reason this 21st century, though being the safest and most peaceful time in all of history. Is also some on the most uncaring, sociopathic fucked up times in history. Well... maybe not. Maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory. 

No-one cares about you, no-one cares about me. I wish I could look out the window and see a fucking meteorite screeching towards Earth.

174,found and performed cpr on dead friend/looking for help,"I found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, I called the ambulance and untied her and gave her CPR for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there.

you wrote out a note explaining everything. hand written, over and over. hell, it’ll never say it all but it gets the point across. they will get a glimpse into what you were thinking. no more frantic late night texts. no more of them pretending to care. no more troubling the ones you love the most. they’ll be sad at first but in time they’ll remember all the good things about you and thats what they’ll say... she was so sweet. her heart was too big for this world. she had so much potential. we all loved her so much.

180,"I called a hotline last week, now I owe thousands.","20m here. Tried overdosing last week but I still woke up. Then I called the hotline cause I needed someone to talk to. I thought it would be like free therapy. Boy was I wrong. Told them what happened, even gave them a fake name and location but the person on the other line deemed that I was a risk to myself. They got the info by pulling up the provider from the phone I was calling from and going to the address listed. Since I moved out, they actually ended up at my parents house while my brother was home and tried to find me there. My heart sank when my brother called me cause I pretty much SWAT'd him just then. The popo called me and I told them my address, they left my brother alone and two paramedics with two officers came to my unit after. They told me I needed to come with them and they would bring me by force if necessary.
Now for context; my mountain of debt, a car accident, and getting fired from several jobs in a row without any potential future prospects all led me to a suicidal state of mind that day. When the ambulance pulled up my heart sank again cause guess what? I have zero insurance.

I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. 

Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. 

I've been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down. Some nights I think about how if I haven't sought help from the hotline that day I might be better off than I am today. Maybe alive or dead, but probably better off either way. I feel intense regret for trying to connect with someone. I didn't leave a suicide note that day. I probably won't ever leave a note when I go.

196,I tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows,"January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?",2020-04-05 12:31:05,68,726,0.99,Pinks_62

200,nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide,"I often fantasize about dying. I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or ""choosing"" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow.",2018-08-08 03:03:52,52,720,0.99,pencilwithnoeraser

Of course, the moment I do leave, everyone suddenly cares, everyone is buzzing my phone asking what's up and how I'm doing, they even got a hold of my parents. It escalated at some point to where the only one from that group I had any respect for is on the phone pleading that I don't die, that suicide is irrational and that I should consider meds.

I've felt half dead for 15 years and for 15 years my parents guided me to the surface at every step. How can I do that to them and take their only daughter away? There is no way. No fucking way I'll allow those two people suffer like that.

&#x200B;

I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.

&#x200B;

I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.

It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged.

&#x200B;

So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of ""suicide watch"", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world?

Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's ""better"" to live. Even if that means living in misery.

&#x200B;

It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I?

I dunno.

&#x200B;

I opened this with the intent on explaining why I feel suicidal. *My* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). But I've been repeating myself as it is online and offline.

If someone is reading this; I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to hold this off anymore. So I'll just imagine that I'm not alone. That maybe this message connects us.

I'll just pretend that someone is reading this. So, just in case I can't hold on, I won't be alone in the end.

Noone would read my suicide note. I don't have a single friend. At 30 years of age I have never been in a relationship. I have no family. Who would read this?

224,I jumped off a (small) bridge,"Surprise! I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

227,Why is it so hard for some people to accept that life just isn't that great for some people?,"Some people just get completely, utterly screwed, traumatized and limited by life, to the point that living just isn't enjoyable anymore. To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

""Does your life have any real meaning?""

I don't want to hurt the ones who care about me, either.  Like my parents. I love them. 


But I am just so damn tired of living.  It would be so nice if I could just fall asleep and not wake up.

231,I don't eat or sleep anymore and I hope it'll kill me.,"As of writing this I have not slept for aprox 60 to 70 hours, have consumed no nutrition or water besides miniscule amounts that my primal instincts demanded of me. But I resist and have not eaten for 40 hours i believe.

And while as the pathetic worthless low value man I am, I can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means. To blow your brains out, jump in front of a train, burn yourself, I could've chosen so many ways.

&#x200B;

But here I am now hoping to perish. Eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely. I don't feel any pain from it anymore, in fact I feel nothing slowly becoming a husk.

I can still think clearly, in fact that is what I wish I couldn't. I can think so clearly that I'm hoping to die even more.

While I write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me, hugging me lovingly, more than a lover ever could, not that I've ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life, or a hug in general that is, not even from a mother.

&#x200B;

Not eating have saved a great deal of money, I used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of. Though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain, it has already happened somewhat. My passions of creativity has no meaning anymore, they're all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form.

&#x200B;

Leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when they're decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose. It has been on mind all my life really, but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one, a family to go on.

But that is not to be, I've reached the point where it's not possible, there is no hope now. And as I view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses I realize how little purpose there is in anything at all. I don't wanna be here anymore.

&#x200B;

And meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols, it could be that I might've finally went to sleep.

&#x200B;

Hopefully to never wake up ever again.

236,"[LONG UPDATE] 16 years old. I went on a walk, and the light was golden on the trees that arched above me. It was like heaven's gates. It was like God telling me to come home.","Linking in my previous post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ht43ep/16\_years\_old\_i\_went\_on\_a\_walk\_and\_the\_light\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ht43ep/16_years_old_i_went_on_a_walk_and_the_light_was/)

I had absolutely no idea that my post would generate such a response. It is 9:32AM here in the UK as I write. I have just woken up and I'm completely blown away.

Evidently, I failed. This is the update I promised. It's long. I hope someone will still read it.

I think I should start earlier on, last afternoon, before I planned to go. I have read every single chat and comment left to me, and it seemed a lot of people related, or were touched in some way, so I think I should offer some of my story in return. Maybe some of you can find yourselves in this update. This is for you.

&#x200B;

I think it was around 3PM yesterday that I decided to end my life. I'd had a relatively uneventful morning. I'd already been on a walk with my mother down to the lake mentioned in my previous post, in efforts to ease some of the emotional tension that had been building for a couple of days. It didn't help. Cutting myself didn't help. I told her I felt trapped.

It was only after the words passed my lips, in the silence of the woods down by the lake, that I realised such language was a hallmark of the suicidal. Trapped. It almost evoked a grin. I hadn't even figured that suicide was already so deeply entrenched in my brain that it was spilling out into my words. I read an excellent book a few years ago where grief was literally a big black bird. It was as if said bird had landed on my scalp and I'd only just realised that its claws were prodding into my brain. What an image.

Afterwards, I got home. Something had finally cracked. I'm not sure what got pills into my brain, but once I'd locked onto the idea, it seemed an obvious choice. I felt a strange sense of clarity and resolution. I knew that it was dangerous to feel that way, but I enjoyed it. I went out into the garden - it was sunny - put my headphones on and listened to the Smiths. I lay down on the grass and crossed my arms over my eyes. I couldn't see, or hear anything (apart from Morrissey). I wondered if this was what it was like to be dead, to have this feeling of being alive but to lack all senses.

The song finished, and I sat up and opened my eyes. Everything was hazy and blue, in that strange way when you've shut your eyes against the sun for too long. It did feel almost heavenly, sat there in the grass. I felt lighter and cleaner than I had in a long time. As stated previously, I'm not a Christian, or any religion for that matter, but it was there in my garden that I first had this sense of God being with me. Everything was beautiful in a way I had never experienced before. It was as if everything had been prepared for me once last time. I felt at peace.

I sat there in the grass until I was called in for dinner. I ate with my family. I couldn't look them in the eyes once. Sticking with the religious theme, it had the same sense of doom as the Last Supper. I almost laughed. I don't know why.

I went out for another walk after dinner, back to the same lake as earlier. I think it had just gone 8PM, so the road through the woods was very empty, and the sun was just low enough in the sky to give that gorgeous golden tint to everything. I have lived in the same house all my life, so I must have walked this road at least a thousand times, but it was as if I was seeing it fresh. The leaves hanging above me looked so light. I saw that golden arch of trees that I mentioned in my other post, just at the end of the road where the woods thickened. It was as if I was being welcomed home. I felt a strange sense of euphoria as I passed through them, like I'd won some sort of prize. I walked past a couple with their dogs. I smiled and said hello. I wonder what the expression was on my face. Did it look as though I was breaking, or was it peaceful?

I got to the lake and sat down on the bench in front of it. The golden light was just skimming the trees - they're tall. It was entirely quiet. I have never known such quiet. The lake was completely still, except for the little circular ripples from the flies hitting the water. The sky had faded into a quiet greyish blue.  It was about 8:30PM. There was nobody else at the lake.

I knew then, in that stillness, that I wanted to go. In that stillness, I felt that every leaf, every pebble, even the rocks at the bottom of the lake had been placed there for me. I don't know whether it was a last-ditch attempt by the universe to get me to stay, or a send off. Like when Simon dies in Lord of the Flies, and all the little silver creatures come to carry his body away on the tide. I think it was a bit of both. It made me feel happy. 

When people freeze to death, they don't feel cold. They feel warm.

I got up, walked back down the road - and the light was fading, but it was still beautiful - and I got home. I messaged a couple of people that I wanted to say goodbye to, just to wish them well. I got changed into my favourite pajamas. I had a cup of tea - how English of me, to have one last cuppa. (I'd never liked this country.) I hugged my mother goodnight and I told her I loved her. I haven't told her I loved her in a decade.

I got into bed - it must have been around 10:30PM by this point - and I wrote my previous post. I'm not sure what I was looking for, by writing it. I didn't expect anyone to respond. I expected it to be the last mark I left on the world. I was okay with that. I hit post. I got a few replies. I responded. It was 11:50PM, I remember it clearly. I turned off my laptop. I went downstairs to get the pills to kill myself.

I barely remember ripping them from the packet. I don't think I felt anything. I was empty as I lined them up. There were only 8, but I'd done my research. One for each year of my life that I'd felt this way. It was enough to die - I don't weigh much - but I realised that it was also enough for me to live. I didn't feel terrible about that. I had responded to one of the comments on my other post about how I was willing to gamble. I had a bottle of water. I was ready.

It was then that I realised my willingness to take a gamble meant that I might want to live. I sat looking at those pills for a long time. I looked at the clock. It was nearly 1AM. I realised I was tired. And the suicide note I'd left was pretty badly written. And there was a party going on, down the street. I figured that even if I took the pills as an act of self harm, not suicide, I'd still have to call an ambulance, and I didn't particularly want that happening in front of a house full of people.

I laughed. It was almost stupid. I wanted to die - I wanted to die so much - but the little things were holding me back. I'd had a perfect send-off from nature. Hell, I'd had a decent last day as a whole. But at the final moment, there were still things that were too amiss for me to go forward. I felt ungrateful. I felt ashamed. I felt empty. But I figured that I could still kill myself another day. It could wait. I went to sleep. I still felt nothing.

&#x200B;

So. I failed, not because I took them, but because I was too afraid to take them. I've been afraid of failure all my life. It's always held me back, but maybe that saved me then.

&#x200B;

I have been assaulted. I have been abused. I have been bullied. 

I have been so physically and mentally ill that I have been forced to plan my own funeral. 

I have been punched so hard that the bruises stuck around on my arm for weeks like little ghosts. 

My life has been peppered by paper trails of suicide notes that I keep tucked in my pocket, and the clink of blades.

I accepted a long time ago that this is just the way it is. Just the way things are. It is the sort of life you might overhear in hushed conversations of the aisles in the supermarket - terribly, terribly sad, and then the conversation is moved on and it is forgotten. Back to the bottles of wine and the crisps.

&#x200B;

But I think there is still a part of me that desperately wants to live. I have so much I want to offer. I write poetry. I want someone to read it sometime. I applied to a summer school. If I killed myself last night, I wouldn't know if I got in. I'm going to refresh my email in a minute, to check.

&#x200B;

I'm here writing this - 11:11AM - and I can still feel that big black bird, sitting on top of my skull. I still want to die. I saved the pills. I put them in a little bag. I understand I might've lost any credibility from my last post - after all, I said I wanted to die and then didn't - but I hope someone is still hearing me. I think I'll take another look at the pills tonight. I hope someone is maybe still holding my hand. I need it so badly.

&#x200B;

But I'm still here, at least for a little while. Maybe a few hours. Maybe days. Maybe years. Maybe just until my 17th birthday, in November. I don't know how long I'll have the courage to hold on for. But I'm still holding on.

I didn't think anyone would listen. This is a really long post - hell, I doubt anyone's reading at this point. But I know I was heard. I woke up to so much love this morning. All I can say is thank you.",2020-07-18 10:27:07,164,677,0.98,DecentBreadfruit

For all these years, I acted like I don’t give a shit about everything, my parents are extremely carefree, living almost like teenagers the day they got an annulment when I was 4. I didn’t grew up with any of them for my whole grade school and they’ve staggered back into my life when I reach mid-high school, I hate them. They made me feel like a burden, like an excess baggage, like I was holding them back to go on with whatever the fuck they wanted to do. I’m sorry if you made a souvenir from you fucked up marriage, trust me I didn’t want to be born either. I’m sorry if you always see your ex-spouse in my face and all of my mistakes, I’m sorry that I looked like a splitting image between the two of you. I’m sorry if I’m not the daughter you hoped for, I’m not academically smart, I failed my year, I couldn’t tell you. I don’t want to hear your judgement anymore, I already know how much of a waste I am. 

I’ve made my decision since April, I gave myself a small deadline but it kept on extending because luckily schools still have a hard time reopening and I feel pretty shitty leaving the two most important people in my life, my best friends.I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist anymore, so they don’t have to grieve and feel like they could’ve done something to save me but I really am just so tired. I can’t tell anyone how I’m feeling, whenever I opened up I’ll get set aside, told to be strong or they say that they’re for me when they’re really not. I dunno why I decided to spill my emotional baggage to a bunch of strangers in the internet but it sucks when I’m more comfortable opening up here than with my friends. 

It didn’t help either that I’m stuck 24/7 inside the house like most people are during quarantine but there had been riots outside and the government being a huge douchebag to it’s citizens. I know I’m being selfish when there are more important matters in the world right now; racism and discrimination, world hunger, poverty, abuse, people who have incurable diseases. I wonder why the world is such a harsh place, I know that life isn’t fair but what the hell?  If I could exchange my life with someone who needs it more, I would. 

I want people to know that I tried. I tried to ask for help, with my family, friends and even try seeking a counselor secretly because apparently, having a mental health problem is considered crazy, an attention seeker or being overly dramatic. My family told me to suck it up, I’ll survive, life isn’t fair. My friends told me they’re there for me but my trust issues says no, suffer on your own, you don’t want to burden them or overshare your sob story, my pride tells me to keep them in the dark with my troubles too because I’ve been perceived as a fighter in our group, I’m always the one who’d they run to when they have a problem, in need of an advice or if there’s a fight amongst us I’m always in the neutral. I don’t want them to see me so vulnerable like this. I reached out to my adviser and then a guidance counselor, I’ve immediately been told that everything between us with be kept confidential UNLESS they see certain signs and they’d immediately tell it to the proper authorities. Yeah, I ghosted him after that message. 

I wonder if those painkillers would really take effect if I swallowed it all. Would it really kill my pain?  

June 25th is my deadline, it sucks coz I’m actually looking a bit forward to my 18th birthday in July 5th but I have to do it. I can’t take anymore humiliation, suffering and disappointment. I’m still a failure.

She was scared said she thought she was a freak. I told her I loved her no matter what. I consoled sisters and called grandmas so I could meet her and her mom at the hospital.  I told her I loved her, and now everything today is like normal. I am hurt. I am so hurt and I don’t want to put that on her.

261,So let me get this straight...I have to do this for another 50+ years?,"So let me get this straight: I never asked to be born, but I was. 

I was born in a shit city and grew up in shit neighborhoods. Still here, still causing mental issues.

I was born with serious mental issues that caused me to harm people when I was younger.  

Never felt human at all or at least not for too long. Could never ground myself and always fantasized about leaving for another world. 

Ah, also unintelligent, going through school with poor grades, school fucked me up and causes my dreams to be themed around it nearly *every night.* Yet, people think I can make it through college. 

For some reason almost always irritable around family and tired of being constantly asked to do things, just want to be left alone. 

People have this romanticized view of me and contradict the truth that I'm evil and mean-hearted and deserve death. No matter how determined I am and how much I build myself up, I can't escape it. 

Pathetic, unless, unreliable, and a child in their mid-twenties. 

Pandemic has taught me how crazy it can drive you to be the house with people all the time. But I realize this just proves even more how mean I am. 

Considering who and what I am, my family would be lying if they say they wouldn't be better off. Who wouldn't reasonably trade not having to deal with that anymore? Or even for something better. 

Humanity can't seem to accept that some people really are not meant for this and a self-inflicted death would be a positive. But they'd rather shame, guilt, belittle, patronize, and spite you into living...because that is the reasonable way to do it...",2020-06-21 02:10:56,89,652,0.99,OhNoMelon313

I was born to a family that doesn’t love me and everyone has treated me like shit except him and now I have to live the rest of my miserable life without him. I’ve prayed for the courage to end it all. I’ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse. The worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but I don’t want anyone else. The thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick. I’m not over my fiancé and I never will be. I think I was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress. I don’t want to live with this pain anymore. I’m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again. I will never marry or have a family. I will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren.

264,the amount of people suffering here is insane,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

edit : one day and this many upvotes? well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me , wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck!
thanks for you all ....you all are my shining hope in this darkness ...im lost here and trying to find my way out of here...
well at least the moment i die i could still think back and see i was never alone in how i saw this world",2020-04-24 22:56:05,40,640,0.99,that-depressed-moon
265,Please read this if you have the time.,"I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore. Please.",2020-04-06 09:43:19,78,638,0.99,ParpikaJnomes
266,"I killed my girlfriend, and now I want to kill myself.."," 

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts.",2018-10-27 00:19:01,61,643,0.98,Human214563246

The fucked up part is that I'm just sitting frustrated about why it didn't go off. I saw my therapist last Saturday and told him about it. He asked if I was willing to bring the gun to him for safe keeping. I complied. Later that day I checked myself into an urgent psychiatric center and they almost kept me. They prescribed Zyprexa instead and after telling my story, the psychologist started crying. That didn't help. The Zyprexa has made me feel numb. I'm not sad, and I'm not happy.

It's left me absolutely shook. Even writing this I'm shaking and my breathing is unnatural. I'm so scared, I'm really fucking scared. This is my first attempt so I've never felt anything like this before, the tears, the shaking, all of it. I can't stop crying, I can't believe this is real. Who knows if I'm gonna even be here next week, the way things are going I'm unsure, and this frightens the hell out of me.

I've had a therapist for the last 6 or so months and it really helped, but as soon as I stopped I instantly when back into my depressive state. I don't want to be stuck talking to a therapist my entire life. So I haven't been back and I don't plan too.

275,"No one will see this but if you do, thank you 🖤","I’m at home with my mum (who is asleep), usually my Stepdad is home too but I told him that my uncle is coming round, with even some false proof, he believed me so he has gone to his hour or two work shift. 

I did it so I could cry on my own, contemplating kms, because for years, since I was about 8 I have been thinking about it, getting stronger over time. I am always paranoid, looking around every corner, everyday contemplating. I just want it to end, so much has happened, people think I have it all, but it is all just a lie. About once a week I look up to see what the quickest way to kms is, to see if someone came up with a new and easy way. 

People say that I’m not alone, they all do, but these days I believe I really am, they say don’t do it. I have ambitions in life, but I know that I will never complete them, I will be gone soon and I know it, never having done any good except a few occasions when I made my family happy. I know what could have been, but now, right now, I’m a waste of a life and there is no reason to go on.  I suffer so much, I have no hope but I know things that I want to do in life, things that I want to see, places that I want to go to, people that I want to meet, but I am literally on the edge. They say call these numbers, go to these groups. They to me are worth nothing. I really wanted to live, but I can’t suffer like this anymore.

I know I will lose this battle one day, but I'm kinda glad it wasn't last night. Also, thanks to all the people who commented that they care, means so much.\*\*

Hopefully, this is my last post. I'm not posting this for attention or pity, it's merely to show I was here, I was a person.

Right now nothing and everything hurts at the same time. I can't breathe, I can't stop crying. Why am I this weak, it's a disgrace to humankind.

I can't take this anymore. I'm sorry to all the people I love, even If the love was not returned.

Thanks for the memories life. Goodbye.

please DONT comment something along the lines of ""i care about you"" or ""i love you"". we are strangers on the internet. you dont know me, i dont know you, we dont know them. that means nothing to the receiving end.

please DO share your own experiences and how they may compare or contrast! i and others would much rather like to hear that we are not alone. theres also no harm in wishing others well rather than telling them things WILL get well.


also, please dont be toxic to each other. i can handle toxic comments, but idk other people's headspaces right now and id rather this post be a chill space than a nasty one.

280,I want to kill myself. I want to die. NSFW,"**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...

I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything.

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have. Who knows I’ll probably fuck that up in the end too.


Edit/Update: 

Hello dear gentle people who heard me and gave me such kindness when I was so low and lost. 

I am alive and yesterday morning I woke up, quit my shitty job and with the day finally to myself, I did something that I didn’t actually ever consider I would do being dyslexic and generally very pessimistic... I wrote a short story. 

Now it’s probably just all purple prose and rambling and dog shit but I was so moved and inspired by all of your sweet remarks of my rants that for once in my miserable little life I believed in me. I finished something, I saw fit to try for once. 

My partner is still an absolute cunt and so completely far up her own arse she might be wearing herself as a hat. I believe now this is probably because of her addictions or her god awful personality that metronomes quickly from toxic, incompetent and dumb to victim mindset mired in lack  of the cursed sickness “melodram-pathetism” and not ever changing. 

For the moment I’m still with her. She’s still emotionally distant and completely unself aware. I will see where this goes but I don’t have a huge amount of hope for her. I have a separate bank account so might indeed save up to get my own place away from everyone including her, even as a temporary measure. I am acutely aware of how little time I have really had all to myself and how little control I have in my life and it has become very clear, almost painfully so, that if she doesn’t care for me then I think she shall not fight for me. 

Until that point. I want to write. I feel like I need to live for something and that my writing can help. If anyone has and tips or pointers for assistance for where and how I can share my work I would be eternally grateful. 

Thank you all for helping me, and to all of those who reached out to me and found themselves in the same curled, gnarled words I put up here; I am only too sorry that there should be others that have to feel in that same way. Which is probably much more saddening than my rant in itself really, that so many more like me feel that way. I’m sorry you have also felt like this. I wish you all the very best and thank you again for your warmth and love. 

Take care.",2020-05-28 20:58:04,85,609,0.99,throwawaaayyyyylol
293,Can you be suicidal but NOT want to die?,"I’m depressed and I self harm, but I don’t want to die. I’m scared to die and I have been happy in the past and I believe that one day (hopefully soon) I’m going to feel better again. 

But at the same time, lately I’ve caught myself thinking/tricking myself into believing that I want to die.

Today I saw my grandmother and haven’t hugged her for a while because of COVID but I did today because I thought “well, soon I’ll be gone so I should hug her one last time”

I was sitting talking to some friends and felt really sad suddenly today because I “realised” that I’ll “probably never see them again” 
Holding my friend’s baby ... “he’ll never know me” 

And I’ve been having intrusive thoughts whenever I’m near anything that could be a suicide strategy - steep cliff, long rope, medications, sharp objects, train, fast traffic. “You should ...”, “you could...”, “why don’t you...”.

I know that I don’t want to die. But I’m scared of the thoughts I’m having and I’m scared I’ll lose control and do something.

I also don’t want to hurt myself, but I do anyway because I can’t control myself. Cutting - (recently started again after not doing it for 10+ years)

I fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail, but the belt was chocking me. I tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me.

Right as I was about to “go out” my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge. It was my last strength. I pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that I was parallel with the bridge. This gave me room to breath again. I swung my arm up and around the rail so that I could attempt to take the belt off and I knew I only had one shot at this. I was successful, but my body gave out after the belt was free and I dropped into the water.

You might just be the help they need! Thank you everyone for reaching out and making me feel less alone. I’m overwhelmed by all the positive responses. I guess not all people are malicious after all. Keep spreading the love ❤️

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

309,"Best friend killed himself, I want to join him","My best friend killed himself at the end of September, and I still can't handle it. I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

He was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.

I called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

I've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.

I failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

I can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.

I just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.

Shane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.

I havent been taking my meds (stupid i know) so i constantly worry about everything, and my suicidal thoughts are through the roof. 

I was sexually assaulted in June, he did put a condom on but that doesnt help or ease my pain and take away the fact that someone I trusted enough took advantage of my body and raped me.

I’m more suicidal than ever, my anxiety is off the roof and I’m scared to have sex again because I’m afraid that my rapist gave me HIV. I will never live with myself and I can’t tell my friends or the boy I’m talking to. I have nobody, no support and I’m afraid to go get tested on Saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done.

But it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences. I could’ve been that pregnant girl. I hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable STD. But that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now I don’t love it anymore.

319,Alone,"We hug goodbye at the airport. You make your way to your boyfriend, waiting for you upstairs and I get into my cab. You're going home where you'll break open your bags and spill presents unto your mum and your boyfriend. 

I'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so I don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. I'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. I won't think about tomorrow, how I'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. I won't wonder if I'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. 

While your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, I'll turn on the TV because the silence kills me. 

It's not that I resent that you have people. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I wish I didn't go back to an empty house all the time, I wish there was someone to say ""welcome home"". I wish that it isn't just Google for me to talk to at home. 

When I'm sick, I become so vulnerable. Broken body, broken spirit. The loneliness eats up at me even more and I wish I could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. Let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. Watch as the pain flows out of my veins.

I want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. Feel myself sway in the wind till I find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. Feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as I become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. The wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. 

I want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. To feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. The demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions. 

If i have to be alone tonight, I wish it could be for the last time.

320,Fuck google,"It pisses me off that when I go searching for information on how to kill myself effectively and without pain all I get are half assed 'don't kill yourself' pages. The internet used to be a source of knowledge and now it's just a bunch of fucking brands and shameless self promoting content creators and seeing it makes me want to kill myself even more.

My fucking mother called the cops on me for saying I had suicidal thoughts once, so no: obviously I'm not going to talk to you about literally anything. Fuck you for making me exist without my consent.

I miss my dead pet. I can't stop picturing her dead, and covered in her own shit.

My fucking wife cheated on me. I read her emails, she was logged in on my PC. He straight up calls her a cunt and a fucking whore. That's who I got left for. I'm a fucking joke, I've been cheated on by everyone I've ever had a relationship with. She took out a credit card in my name and now I'm harassed every single day by people trying to get money from me. I'm in debt and I have no way out. She fucked this dude and now she's producer on his film. Can't wait for that to come out. I feel like everyone is laughing at me, the manlet cuck who got btfo.

I have intrusive thoughts about my genitals being mutilated all the time that cause me to physical wince, that is when I'm not literally spasming, probably from Parkinsons which runs in my family. I say shit out loud unconsciously like: ""Fucking kill myself"" and ""He killed himself"". I jerk myself awake at least once every night.

I cannot see anything getting better from here. It hurts every day and I'm filled with impotent rage.

331,Going from suicidal to very happy all in the same day,"I feel so lonely because I've never found anyone else who feels the same way. I have depression and ever since the really really bad times I've never quite related to any other depressed person. For example fake smiling (never had to do that unless I was on the brink of tears at school) I genuinely felt happy but I was still depressed.

Most of the times I think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. Like when a friend unconsciously leave me out I think of suicide and I start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable. Or one day I can be sure I just want to die and the next I can feel like I'm on top of the world. I also mainly get depressed when I'm on my own and not with friends.

Anyone else feel like that? Or is it just me?

332,Anyone else badly want a relationship but know it’s a terrible idea,"How could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable, some getting their thoughts out, some contemplating ending it, some already having decided and making their last remarks.

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it. I’ve turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses. Will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery.

333,Is it normal to think about death all the time?,"I think about death all the time. I think about how, after my mom passes, I’ll die. I think about sending my boyfriend and the dog away to visit his family, and then finding new homes for my cats, and then just ending it. I know there are people other than my mom who love me, who would be sad if I died, but they’d move on eventually. They have other friends and family. They don’t -need- me.

I tried to tell a friend recently how I’ve been feeling, and she told me that she needed me, her best friend, to live for her. Which is a lie. She has a loving fiancé and tons of other friends. She would be sad, but ultimately my death would mean nothing, even to her, after some time. She doesn’t need me.

My boyfriend, he might need me, but I don’t feel like I’m good for him. Not when I spend nearly every waking moment wishing for my own death. How can I support him when I can’t even support myself? He moved very far  away from home to be with me, but he is probably better off back home with his family, in an environment where he is actually comfortable. He might need me, but that doesn’t mean I’m good for him.

I don’t want anyone to need me either. I want it to be okay to die after my mom passes. I don’t want to spend another 30+ years struggling on this earth. I never even imagined I’d make it into my 30s. To make into my 60s? Impossible. What’s the point?

Life just feels so meaningless. Even when I try to find meaning, I always hit roadblock after roadblock. Depression and anxiety always hold me back. I’m so tired of trying, of fighting, of being.

336,Being born is some sick cosmic fucking joke. And its not a funny one.,"When does life become worth living? Because there is absolutely nothing here for me. Nothing that makes life worth living.

My girlfriend raped me in November. I tried to kill myself and amassed some hospital bills. Then she abused me and kept me addicted to drugs for 7 months. I was in a addict IOP and it did nothing because of her. She caused my suicide attempt. This may sound like I’m not holding myself accountable for my behavior, but it is fact that she caused my suicide attempt.

Then I failed all of my classes. I was enduring abuse, I was severely depressed, I hated myself, and I was suicidal. She isolated me from all of my friends and family. My relationships with everybody else in my life haven’t been the same since.

Then in May I had a manic episode. I went fully crazy. I was psychotic. I was hospitalized again against my will for a week. My ex-girlfriend broke up with me while I was in the psychiatric hospital over the phone.

I was still manic when I got out. So I texted her. I thought we were still dating. I really did. I was psychotic and I thought she was still my girlfriend. I texted her mother begging and pleading. I was still in love with her daughter even though she raped me and abused me. It destroyed me. She was cruel and she insulted me and laughed at me.

Then they pressed charges against me. “Telecommunications harassment.” Now I’m on probation for 3 months. I owe the county $500 that I don’t have. I don’t have a job. I have to take a behavior class that costs $100. I have to do 24 hours of community service. She’s getting what she wanted— she’s ruining my life.

I am only 19. I’m a teenage girl. I am in so much debt. I don’t have a job. I can’t go back to school. I’m becoming depressed again. I live with my parents and I’m convinced they think I’m a freeloading loser and they want me dead.

I don’t have any friends left. I don’t have a support system. My only option is to kill myself. There is no justice for me. This will never be reconciled. I have to kill myself.",2020-07-21 16:34:03,30,566,0.99,bloodvirgo

339,Too Cowardly To Kill Myself But Too Depressed To Keep Living,"This is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write. To establish things immediately, no I am not considering s\*\*cide or am I in immediate danger. I would never do that to my mom, the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me.

With that said, I think I'm just done with life. It's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. It doesn't have much to do with the Coronavirus or the Riots but those have been the final straws. The Coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things I enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. Luckily workouts have resumed in my state so I can do that. The riots have taken away my love for sports and history. It seems like everything I love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

Even the activities I enjoy I don't enjoy as much as I used to. I feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that I now feel constantly.

The Coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. God is definitely not in my life and I am angry at him for various things (that I'll get into here in a minute). I am single and I have no kids or even pets to keep my company. While others at least had family to keep them company I've had no one. This Coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. Most of my family live in another state and I would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. Plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

I have failed so often at dating it's become comical. I decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. I went on a date on Tuesday that I thought was going well. We played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. We didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. I contact her Thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. Needless to say I sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her I thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing I had no chance. Like so many other times in my dating life I just felt used.

Besides being single with no kids or no pets I don't have a lot of friends. The few I do have know I struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. They all think I'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe I'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. I just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

Besides that my body failed on me pretty early. I'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. Always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. Now I'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. I was on a flight to Nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. I started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. No medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. Now my doctor has me take a Xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a Prednisone 50mg tablet to control the Asthma. It's worked but whereas I used to love flying I now dread it. I feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, I don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. But there's so many places I've wanted to see. I've asked my doctor about it and I've asked a Pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. I think they think it's all mental for me at this point. Ever since I became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

So besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. I know I've suffered from some Anxiety like I mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with Depression. My mind is always half empty and I think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

All in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. That we get multiple chances at this life and that I'll just get another chance. I know Christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. I will say this, I think God made a mistake having me be born during this time. I believe I was born in the wrong time.

I have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. I've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. I've always been adrift in terms of what I want to do. Yes I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Management and Marketing. I also have my SHRM Certification as a Certified HR Professional. But if I'm honest I don't have a passion for any of it.

So my personal life is a mess. My physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. I don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. I feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. The Coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. The Riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. They hate me just for being a white conservative male.

I am a walking contradiction. I don't want to die and don't have to guts to but I've lost most of my will to live. I've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and I no longer have any zest for life. Deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. Sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but I've lost the ability to feel happy. I've lost the ability to connect with people. I've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. I just feel like I don't care anymore.

I don't know what I'm asking for out of this, I just had to finally get it out. I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could I really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. I wouldn't make all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would try to not be so da\*n introverted when I was younger which made it hard to make friends. I would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. I would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

I don't anymore guys. It just all feels so hopeless. If I had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment I think that's the one I would use. Hopeless.

358,I got a gun to kill myself and my parents found out about it before I could do it.,"Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing.",2019-10-07 16:52:36,60,548,1.0,-BrainDead

362,Casually suicidal?,"I would love for things to stop. Time to hold still and so slowly fade. Suicide will never be that peaceful.
I think abt death often. I don't necessarily have plans for life. I'm just patiently waiting for death. Like at a bus stop. I might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful I can't help but to want to go there. 
I'm constantly afraid. Of everything. Feeling silence would be amazing

Point of this? Idk I never told anyone this cus they would worry but I feel like i need to. Don't worry tho~ most likely I won't be taking an active role. I've desired death even stronger than now and I've been too afraid. So.

Edit : thanks for the comments. Its nice knowing I'm not alone. If anyone would like advice since I'm just ""waiting at my bus stop"" doing what I can enjoy has been a great way to spend time.

363,I was born a hermaphrodite and I want to die because of it.,"I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.

365,Throwaway because I deserve to die.,"I a 24 year old male was raped by an attractive woman in my university my sophomore year. 

Edit: It keeps getting buried in comments I have no insurance or no employment I have 300 dollars to my name & have inquired about planned parenthood and urgent care testing it’ll be around $200-$250 to get tested without insurance and I simply can’t afford that right now. Plus planned parenthood in my area is not testing until July.


After it happened I dropped out of school and couldn’t explain to my parents why I came home why I was so unmotivated. 

the people I told my story to couldn’t believe a black guy in the military could be taken advantage of by a petite white woman.

Today while getting out the shower I noticed a single red bump in my genital area I had shaved the area a few days ago so I figured it could’ve been a razor bump.

I’ve been disgusted with my body since the assault happened so I’ve avoided sex since & I’ve gone from weighing 130 pounds to weighing 162.8 lbs and ordering takeout nearly every night eating the pain away.

After a drunk night and letting my anxiety get the best of me I decided to become a webmd doctor and self diagnose myself and the bump on my penis looks like it could be herpes.

I’m so afraid to get myself checked because if it’s herpes my life will be ruined I’ll never have a normal life again no man or woman will want me & I’ll be forced to be alone.

I’m already a college dropout on the way to 25 years old unemployed 

At this point I’m a failure in life and when I get the balls to get checked out if it turns out he herpes or something incurable I believe the best course of action is to immediately remove myself from the gene pool and get rid of this disease the only way I know possible and kill myself.

Which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. Honestly I cant even remember how to multiply or divide, It's humiliating.

I didn't see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back & took me along with her to this small town that I'm in now.

378,Therapy was the worst thing that happened to me,"A few years ago when I was suicidal I was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible.

380,"In twenty six days, I am throwing a moving away party. I don't have the heart to tell my friends I am thinking about taking my life shortly afterwards rather than go through with my move.","It's strange to me how happy I feel now that I've picked the date. I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  


The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.  


I know this will break some people close to me. That tears me up so bad. But in the end, this is something I need to do for myself.",2019-07-07 17:58:36,49,532,1.0,throwaway729941
381,I cried tonight realizing that suicide was not an option anymore,"For most of my life, I have found tremendous comfort in knowing that suicide was a dependable way out when everything was just too much.  Like a safety net... but the opposite.  In my mind I would play out different scenarios -- some quick and practical, others more extravagant and poetic.  I would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto.  It was a huge help.

Recently, I have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving, and tonight I realized that if I was to end my life, it would completely break her.  So now, with great sadness, I have had to say goodbye to my reliable friend and protector.  The future seems so much harder now.

382,How do people work everyday in jobs they hate without wanting to kill themselves?,"I mean seriously.

My sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. Her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

392,"I just want to sleep and never wake up again, anyone else feel the same?","I'm  24 years old. On the outside I lead a perfectly normal life. I have a  decent salary, friends I speak to regularly, I get along with everybody  at work. I do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

If  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that I've been  diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. I've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.

I am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.

I  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum.

396,"16 years old. I went on a walk, and the light was golden on the trees that arched above me. It was like heaven's gates. It was like God telling me to come home.","Title. I'm thinking of ending it tonight. I went on a walk down to this lake by my house and God, it was beautiful. It was like one final send off from nature - almost as though in that moment, it had been put there for me. The lake was perfectly still, and that golden light was just gracing the tops of the trees. I'm not actually religious, but I think it was the universe's way of telling me to let go, to return to God.

I'm suicidal for a whole range of reasons. Have been for 8 years - half my lifetime. I've never come so close to ending it before. Something suddenly clicked a couple of nights ago and things became too painful to bear. The straw that broke the camel's back. I started cutting again. It didn't help. Nothing makes a dent in this pain and shame.

I can't tell if this handful of pills means I actually want to go, or if it's a cry for help. I know it's pathetic - but I think I'll only take 8, that's in the potential danger zone for people of my weight. It will be in the hands of the universe to decide if it's my time to go.

I just want someone to hear me. There are 690 people online. I hope someone's there to listen. I hope someone will maybe hold my hand over the internet if I go. It's a funny image, those hands reaching through those computer screens, but it makes me tear up.

I hope that if I succeed, someone else fails. Your life is worth something, if you're reading this. Mine isn't.

397,I want to commit suicide on Xmas Eve just like my sibling,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

407,My 15 year old brother hung himself and all I want to do is die too...,"I just feel so hopeless. So fucking hopeless. Everyday I wake up and think about him and how the possibility of me moving out at 18 caused him to despise me and hate me. I had become increasingly distant weeks before he passed because I was so busy with work, getting a new apartment, etc..and I hate being so mad at myself for not being able to be there. I wish I would have been the one to die instead. I am a bitter and angry person all the time and no matter what I do I just can’t seem to get rid of all this anger and aggression I feel. My boyfriend doesn’t help. Just gets mad at me for being mad. I just want to give up. I haven’t cut for over a year but lately it’s been the only thing to help anything. I just want my brother back. I’ve never thought suicide was so selfish until I lost my best friend and all I want is to see him again. It hurts, a piece of my heart is gone. I just wish I could have been the one to die instead.

409,The Foo Fighters saved my life,"This Sunday night, I was about to end my life. I took a few Painkillers, Sleeping Pills and drank some beers. I was just about to slit my wrist, when the radio played my absolute favorite song, My Hero. 
This song finally gave ma a little bit of a good feeling, a big improvement after days of pure numbness, just enough to get me to call an ambulance.

I’m now in a hospital and the suicide thoughts are finally slowly fading away. I hope, it stays this way.

410,I would rather kill myself than grow as a person,"I'm fucking done with life man. Life fucking sucks in every which way. I do not want to be honest about who I am. I do not want yo grow. I do not want to accept anything. I do not want responsible. I don't want to work hard or be a part of anyone's life. I don't want to make a difference or contribute to society. Having a career of any kind is too much fucking work. The truth is I'm perfectly happy to be a leech until nobody is willing to help me out. The. I'll logically be on the streets and at that point I will kill myself. But why let it go that far? Why shouldn't I buy a gun ASAP and be done with it before life even has the opportunity to force me to try being responsible and engaging in the world around me, when I want nothing to do with that? I'm a loser and I'm okay with that. Not being a loser is seriously too much work. Giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work. I just want to kill myself before anyone that knows me figures out that I don't give a shit about my life or other people and I'm not interested in the least in being responsible in any sense of the word.",2019-05-21 07:48:40,67,503,0.99,What_I_do_45

I remember when I was a kid and I thought I’d have a wife or girlfriend when I grew up, what a fucking joke. Instead here I am stuck in my fucking room because of the fucking dumbass quarantine and no school just wanting to kill myself because no one gives a shit about me

I’ve started texting this girl that I asked out and she of course rejected me because I’m a lowlife piece of shit. She always hits me up first and she’s the only reason basically I have any hope at all except deep down I know she doesn’t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

Because of the fucking pandemic I don’t even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when I feel myself and can express myself and don’t want to fucking kill myself. My best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and I’m completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won’t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn’t because of the quarantine. 

I’m not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this I just wish I had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it’s gonna be ok and I wish I could say this stuff to my friends but I’m a man and I can’t show emotion or I look like a pussy, I just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy I’m such a loser idk I just want to be happy again it’s been so long

420,I want to die but afraid of dying!!!,"Death. Death. Death. That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death. What will happen to me after committing suicide? I keep asking myself this question whenever I think of suicide. I also ask myself these questions: how will my loved ones react to my death? What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. As you can tell, I am contradicting myself all the time. That is because I am lost. And very sad. I want to die.",2020-02-13 19:48:18,72,496,0.99,aNewReality34

423,Young doctor (29yo) with suicide thoughts,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story.

I love music and painting things and I was here once, too.

things with my family are messy. they want to love me, I think, but things can get in the way. I wasn't what they were expecting, even less so what they were hoping for. I know they'll be okay if they believe that they tried to fix me, and I hope the best for them.

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

You are all worthy of happiness. I'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated.

433,I'm a waste,"Tonight I was going to do it. In my parents' home. I was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die. 

My mom walked in when I was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where I'd cut later tonight. She said ""I just wanted to see you."" I had to hide my body under the covers so that I could keep her from seeing what I had done to my arm and my body at that point. She came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap. ""It's comfortable,"" she said. I tried my best to hold back tears. 

She eventually left and now I'm here, staring at my razorblade, wondering why I'm left here as a sympathetic, pitiful loser. All I can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood-stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top. I can imagine her crying. 

I feel like a waste of money and time. The thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much. The time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that would've been better spent anywhere else. The only time I enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music. I am less than mediocre at both. 

My whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring. I've lied about my age online so that guys wouldn't be afraid to talk to me. I've created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so I can make my other friends jealous. I lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what I want them to do. As for the attention whoring, I've done enough of it in my early teens. At 14, I was telling men online that I was 18. Id send them pictures of myself so that I could get validation. I craved the romantic attention that I never got at that age.

It's now 12am and I'm still here, scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds. I've taken breaks while typing this and I feel like I'm ready. I just need some validation that I'm not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves. 

So. Speaking of decisions that I made that fucked up my life.
I'm living with 43° scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that (shocker) I have given to myself. I, as the attention whore I was in elementary school, longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school. I sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan. The next scoliosis check that I had, I was told to get checked for scoliosis. Lo and behold, now I'm at a 43° curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix. 
I also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that I could get glasses. Now I'm stuck with 7mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that I'm legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses. 
I AGAIN fucked up my life when I decided to go along with my parents' narrative and pretend to be Christian. Now I've been working at my church for 6 years. I've also been attending and tithing every week. I'm in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat. After 14 years of church, I still don't know what the fuck is going on.

I'm tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay!!!!

I'm tired of asking for help and never getting any

I'm tired of lying to people

I'm tired of being a waste of time and money

I'm tired of being completely mediocre

I'm so tired 

It is now 1am and I'm going to do it in 3 hours. 

time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note.

would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays? idk

thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby-babble

edit: haha im still here. im still here. im still here.

i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note, trying to justify myself, trying to excuse myself from living. i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends. i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically. a dark, dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning. i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want. i read the beginning of my note and pity the author. my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy. 

am i going insane? i cant follow through on anything, and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt. i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly. now im 5 hours late to my own death.

i read the comments in this post and I've spent the past 5 minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you I'm still here. i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you. i guess my answer will come in time. 

in the meantime, im still here and I still feel like shit. i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation.",2020-06-17 05:13:02,46,483,0.98,tellmepleaseiloveyou

435,Suicide is on my mind 24/7 but I know all that I really want is to feel like I’m loved.,"Hi everyone, my name is Everett. I’m turning 15 soon and I’ve grown up in an abusive religious family. I switched schools last year because I had to take care of my grandparents because they can’t support themselves anymore. My last school I got bullied a lot and people didn’t take me seriously when I talked. I don’t get bullied at my new school but it’s because of other reasons. People started making rumors of me at my new school that I was gonna kill everyone and “shoot up” the school.i don’t know who my real friends are and which ones just don’t want to be the “target” for “when I shoot up the school” because I have Asperger syndrome. I’ve been rejected my whole life to the point where I have no self confidence. My longest relationship ever was 1 month. I want something that’s longer but I feel like no one trusts me. My mother hates me because I constantly fuck up, and I turned out to be a male at birth instead of female. She wanted a girl. My real dad is a drunk bastard and I disconnected ties with him 2 years ago. My step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks I have to follow his religious rules but he doesn’t. He constantly emotionally abuses me when I do things “not holy”. I’ve wanted to run away since I can remember up till about 6th grade when I realized with my state’s laws that I can’t and it would be easier to end myself. So I’ve attempted suicide 5 times since then and I’m such a failure I can’t even kill myself properly. Again, you might say that “I don’t need a girlfriend at my age” but i feel as if that is the only thing I want anymore. I recently got a job and I bought a few things that I thought might help but of course it didn’t. I just want to feel as if I’m loved and I want to turn my sadness into love for them. But of course I can’t have it. I’m doubting what I believe in right now. The only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats. I also think I’m a psychopath. Ive pointed a loaded .22 at my step dad before and if anything I should’ve pulled the fucking trigger. But of course, I’m such a fucking pussy I couldnt even do that properly . People keep telling me it’ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse. Parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted. I constantly build everything up because I don’t want to hurt anyone and I don’t know when it’ll come out. Everyone that I think I might have a chance with pushes me away after I express my feelings to them.it just has gotten to the point I can remember the last time I’ve smiled.

I broke down in the shower just thinking about how close I was to not being here.

I start counselling soon and I'm going to make a big effort to try and turn my life around. I've spent long enough being miserable and I deserve to be happy.

439,I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live,"Sometimes, I wish I could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can. I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward.

452,This will get lost in a sea of Suicide notes,"I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. 

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it.",2019-11-23 12:11:54,42,477,1.0,libratd98

Sure not as shitty as some others have it, but it's all shitty. I was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that, I was always meant to die alone. I tried to avoid it but by 30 it became clear the path I was going down.

More importantly, I just never was happy with myself or life in general. Losing loved ones, losing touch with friends and never making new ones, being bored with the work I chose but having no interest in going back to school. Life is just not worth it to me. Lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside. I said if I wasn't feeling better by 31 I'd end it, and here I am. I'll miss my family but I'm done ""being strong for others."" Time to take care of myself.

I chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick. Yeah I know ""you might screw up"" but oh well, that's a risk I'll take. Oh and I'm sure someone will show up to tell me I'll go to hell like they always do to people here, and yeah, I'm shaking in my boots ;) lol.

I'm done hearing how women deserve to be raped and confined in chains.

I'm done with my fucking low-functioning sociopathic half-brother who sets my father off and makes him abuse the rest of us once he loses it, including my poor dog.

I've never worked. Never had a boyfriend in real life. Never had a real life friend since I was 11. I graduated high school online a year late with a GPA of 1.7 because he wouldn't let me study.

It doesn't even hurt to say it now. In fact, this is the first time I haven't cried all night, because I've accepted it.

I can't drive. No ID or money for a bus. I don't even know where my social security number is. There's no women's shelter, or any shelter, in this piece of shit town he confines us in. Hell, I probably wouldn't make it if there was, I'd be raped or abducted into human trafficking before I got there, that's the kind of place it is.

472,"Sleeping and dreaming is the only enjoyment I get daily, anymore","Each day I wake up as I near closer to 24, I feel as though little has been felt to be accomplished by myself in my wandering through every new week. 

It’s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where I am now— to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself. I have no direction. I have no college education, my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless, giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded, at times to perform adequately.

I have a relationship, I suppose I am better for it, but each day I wake up, I feel as though every moment I try to engage with my partner, I bring him down in my depression. It seems only too much, the burden of my love; I feel I’m just too heavy a weight on those around me. 

I have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries, simple things like helping around the house. 

Perhaps my issue is my mental illness I have yet to be diagnosed with, but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort. 

The crushing debt of sadness I get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness I can achieve is simply that— a dream.

It is selfish, but I lose my will to live more and more; I care little about actually dying, it seems the only person I am afraid to hurt is my beloved, but I fear I can’t stay suffering like this much longer, worrying about money, my worth, the pain of simply living. It has been months coming that I have been wasting away.

 Exercise only distracts my heart when I have someone with me, and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins, so much so before we finish the outing.

Calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards, but I try my best to hang on, if only out of love for my fiancé.

I feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now, I am still young, but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind? I can’t enlighten myself to give much more, I feel. 
I feel the time is coming for my life to end by my own hand, as I can’t reckon enough willpower to handle the listlessness and longing for joy to come back. 

I don’t know when I will do it, but I try to encourage myself to make it to the end of the year, but I sense as though I may not make it to the end of this month.",2020-06-06 08:38:00,35,455,1.0,CantyCoyote
473,"""it will get better"" being the biggest lie ive been told. I desire suicide.","I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems. 
I don't think anything could save me now.

486,My boyfriend comes from 3 generations of suicide. He took his life in November 2017. I am really fucking depressed. We have a 7 year old daughter. I feel ill every moment of every day.,"He was my best friend. I have constant nightmares. We struggled so much after his death - I got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. I battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at Christmas because she missed her Daddy. That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. The rumor went around that her Dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. 

I worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best I could. I found every resource possible for her. But I didn’t take any time for myself I guess. My family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her Dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. My mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. She also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her Dad’s side of her family. She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country. My mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. She can’t handle not having control over my daughter.

So I’ve been battling with Child Protective. My mom filed for custody of my daughter. There have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on DHS and they aren’t fucking around with anything. So even though I’m an amazing mother, have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief - I’ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me. If you thought those upity moms judged us then, you should see how they judge us now.

I’m done with it all. My daughter is now a stranger to me. It’s been 7 months without her and I really have no purpose in life anymore. I mean, I know my worth but being involved with the State and system rips your entire soul up. 

I have no fucking purpose to live. I understand why her Dad left. I want to leave also. ",2019-01-13 21:33:26,67,441,0.98,kaykay101111
487,I'm this fucking close to ending it. [17M] Really Really Really Long. Sorry. Might be graphic. Might get offended. Discretion advised. IDK.,"First of all, I don't know if I need or even want help. Maybe I just want some anonymous people sitting behind computer screens to sympathize with me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now other than venting. My ""life story"" might come out as very very long but its the only way I can express and explain what I'm going through right now. I can't just do a tl;dr for this.

Just to make things clear: My father is an abusive, manipulative, psychopathic, wife-beater, piece of shit. I was/am not abused with the sack of shit, but my mother has been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abused.

Here we go (Some parts obscured):

I was born to international parents, as in they are both different nationalities. Upper middle class to lower upper class. NOT ""rich"" because my father doesn't understand how credit cards, loans, mortgages or saving money works. I've moved plenty of times more than I count on my two hands, living in 4 different countries including birth country. I will refer to them as country 1, 2, 3, 4, in order of moving.

I lived in my birth country(1) for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where I genuinely could smile and have fun. I would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital(fairly small town), we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school. We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.

My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of ""fights"" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in ""trouble"" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.

Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was ""living expenses"" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.

After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \[no offense to overweight people\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).

Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were ""problems with immigration"" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).

I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally ""wrong"" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was ""patrolling"" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was ""popular"") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as ""help""; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.

That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too ""tired"" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was ""fine"" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.

As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.

Like I said, I don't know if I'm here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don't know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don't know.

EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I'm feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.

To those who might be a bit confused, I've begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she's in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me.",2020-03-22 17:09:47,59,447,0.98,YeetItAway2020
488,Have you ever gotten jealous over hearing about someone's suicide?,"Now i did not personally know this guy, I left my town's school in 6th grade, and he moved to my town about a year or two after so I never went to school with him but I knew of him cause he hung out with my friends from town. Anyway, I am 24 now. A few days ago, I started seeing people posting ""RIP"" statuses on social media, and posting tributes to him with pictures and what not. Apparently, he was really depressed for awhile and finally decided he had had enough. At first I felt bad, and I still do. But then I started to feel really jealous, because since i was 12 i have been clinically depressed and have tried so, so many times in the past decade to kill myself, but it was never successful at it, and not a day has gone by that I haven't wanted to be dead. And apart of me is thinking ""it's not fair that he got to die and i'm still here"". Has anyone else ever felt like this?",2019-11-30 18:00:18,37,439,0.98,
489,"I don’t want to kill myself, but I still want to die.","I just give up. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel, it won’t get better, I can’t just get through this bit... that’s what people always say, they’ve been telling me things will get better for years. Well they haven’t yet and they never will, because I don’t fucking try to improve my own life, because I don’t care, because I deserve to suffer.

The voices came back strong. I’m starting to agree with them more and more. They’re right, he doesn’t care, no one does. There is no way to get better, no one wants to help, no one will. 

You can’t make it better, so why try. I’m not even good enough to kill myself, I can’t do anything, i just want it to take me. I give up on even trying. I’m just going to walk awayand let it take me.",2019-04-15 12:06:23,49,447,0.99,BB960228

491,My last day.,Today is my last day. I cant deal with my mental health any longer. Its been 27 years of pure hell. I have only been fighting so others wouldnt be uncomfortable if i killed myself. I wont do it any more. I have great things going for me on the outside but inside me it is my own personal hell. I have done everything to try to overcome this and nothing works. For several reasons. I am terrified to die but it has to be better than the hell i live every second of my life.,2019-09-18 13:08:41,123,444,0.99,trekiebabe
492,"Fuck the future, friends getting houses, a living wage. I'm so tired of feeling hopeless","First off, fuck winter. I'm so tired of spending the entire winter wanting to end it. Its ridiculous.

With the general election coming up, it's just gonna fuck over the country even more and I'm already broke. Like £2 in the bank broke until tomorrow night. And now friends are setting deposits on houses and settling into well paid jobs that are over 20k a year. 

Its just a repeating cycle of hopelessness. Theres literally no chance of not struggling for my entire life and I cant keep dealing with it. I'm so tired of being happy for a day then watching as everything just falls apart around me. 

I'm so fucking tired. I hate my job. I'm too depressed to write my cv since theres nothing positive to say, and I feel stupid for even thinking that. I'm just so done.",2019-11-29 18:30:15,40,438,0.99,WhyRedTape
493,I lived,"I wrote a post [On March 19, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fl8n2m/overdosing_soon/) telling anyone who'd listen that I was going to overdose. And I did. 

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent. But since I've been on a 5051 previously, (this time I wasn't, I was at the ward voluntary; I need help, I know that much and I'm open to getting it) that plan will be much much harder. 

Still, I am alive and I was doing really good! the meds are working, it's just that stray thought that's just started growing. But I'll bring that up tomorrow in PHP. 

Life might always say No to what I want, and Death said no to my needs.. but fuck you - I'm not saying no to getting help!

496,"I have never had affection in my life, respect or trust, and I was abused and gaslit by my whole family for over 20 years. Suddenly, my brain is convinced that suicide is a realistic option?","Some backstory is needed here.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and ""you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable"".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

Thank you in advance.



P.S. I see many of you contacted me privately, but that's a lot of you, so don't be upset if I can't answer: I appreciate.",2019-12-21 13:59:37,30,438,0.99,95girl

498,Im ugly inside and out,Im a fucking failure. What’s the point of even living a mediocre life ? Even my family dont understand why I’m feeling like this they say I have everything. The thing is I’m disgusting looking I can’t even look at myself in a mirror. Why can’t I die already ? I know people care about me. And I can’t even self harm anymore. I’m constantly crying for no reason. I hate my useless worthless ugly self and I don’t want to live everyday of my life seeing my miserable face. People who care about me they don’t even care or at least they won’t care long. I want to disappear and nobody remembering me. I’m a worthless human being not even good to look at and not talented. A lot of people have it way worse and I’m still complaining which makes me even more pathetic. I hope today it’ll work.,2020-05-14 19:15:29,34,432,0.99,Aw-Jee
499,I Can Always Just Die After Graduation,"I don't think I want to continue living in this world after I graduate college. I still have over a year left, but I worry about my future every single day. I don't think I'm cut out to live in this highly competitive world. I struggle enough already as a student and have no passions or ideas about what I want to do. I want to exist, but not the way the majority of people in this society have to exist. So, my thoughts go to suicide quite a bit these days. I think to myself, ""I can always just die"" and then I won't have to deal with any of it anymore. I don't want to work my life away. I'd rather just be dead and move on to whatever comes next. I'm just so scared.",2020-01-03 18:22:29,44,433,0.99,rainbowtrout97
